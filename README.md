** Pizza Sales Analysis using SQL and Excel**
This project showcases an in-depth analysis of pizza sales data using SQL for database querying and Excel for data visualization. The goal of this project is to analyze pizza sales trends, customer preferences, and business performance to provide actionable insights that can help optimize sales and marketing strategies for a pizza business.

**Project Overview:**
The dataset used for this project contains detailed records of pizza sales, including information such as transaction IDs, sale dates and times, customer demographics, pizza categories, and quantity sold. The data spans over a specific time period and represents the sales performance of various pizza items offered by the business.

**Key Objectives:**
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The initial step involved cleaning the raw sales data to ensure accuracy and consistency. This includes handling missing or inconsistent entries and formatting the data for further analysis.

SQL Queries:
Using SQL, I performed various queries to extract meaningful insights. Some of the key queries include:

Total sales revenue over time.
Identifying the best-selling pizzas.
Analyzing customer demographics (e.g., age, gender) to understand buying patterns.
Finding peak sales times and days to optimize business operations.
Key Insights from SQL Analysis:

Which pizza category contributes the most to overall sales.
The highest-revenue generating time slots (peak hours).
Customer segments that make frequent purchases.
Seasonal trends in pizza consumption.
Data Visualization in Excel: I used Excel to create visualizations that offer an intuitive understanding of the data. Key visualizations include:

Pivot Tables to summarize total sales by pizza category, customer demographics, and time.
Bar and Line Charts to represent trends in sales over time, highlighting peak sales periods and low-performing months.
Pie Charts to display the proportion of sales contributed by different pizza types.
Business Insights and Recommendations: Based on the analysis, the project provides several actionable recommendations for the business:

Increase inventory for top-selling pizzas during peak hours and high-demand seasons.
Target marketing campaigns toward high-frequency customer demographics.
Adjust staffing and operations to optimize for busy periods and reduce wait times during high-demand hours.
Tools and Technologies:
SQL: Used for querying and data extraction to gather key insights from the database.
Excel: Utilized for data cleaning, pivot tables, and creating visualizations like charts and graphs to present findings clearly.
Microsoft SQL Server: As the database management system to store and manage pizza sales data.
Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how SQL and Excel can be combined to perform comprehensive data analysis and generate valuable business insights. The findings from this project can help pizza businesses understand customer behavior better, optimize sales strategies, and improve overall profitability.
